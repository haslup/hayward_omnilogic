# Hayward API

Beginnings of a library that talks to Hayward OmniLogic devices.

Note: You'll need to setup the relays, lights, and groups to the IDs that correspond to your pool, of course. Easiest way will be to use this class interactively and use the `verbose` option to see the primary system status response.  It should have all your devices listed.
